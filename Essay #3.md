**_3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community? http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program_**

I have long contributed to the African American community and worked on behalf of underrepresented minorities.  As the Director of Development for Northwest African American Museum, I raised $17 million for the $22 million capital campaign establishing Museum at the Colman School on the lid of I-90.  The museum is thriving and still exists today.  Throughout the fundraising efforts for the Museum, we hosted many parties and events celebrating Northwest African American heritage and the exhibits which were to be held in the Museum.  The main exhibit “The Journey Gallery” chronicles the migration patterns related to specific timeframes of Northwest African American history.  As a native Northwesterner myself who was born and raised in Seattle, I have a specific story to tell about when and why my parents migrated here.  Many people in Seattle and in Tech are transplants and it is somewhat rare to find native Northwesterners.  I delight in sharing the stories we collected at the Museum as well as my own to shed light on what it is like being a native Northwesterner in the African American population.

For ADA, I would organize get togethers for the program around specific topics whether it is an outing to a movie like “Hidden Figures” which relates to both African Americans and the Tech/Engineering field or a potluck celebrating different foods of the cultures who migrated here.  My daughter and I made a Trinidadian dish called Pelau with my father who immigrated from there for her school’s multicultural night and shared a posterboard with a copy of the recipe, a native Trinidadian poem and pictures of Carnival.  

As a Receptionist at Microsoft through Novitex Enterprises, we receive a list of meetings being held in the company’s large public meeting spaces weekly.  Get togethers like these abound for the company whether it is the Blacks At Microsoft group meeting with CEO Satya Nadella to discuss initiatives which will pull in Black employees or the Microsoft Irish Club hosting a series of get togethers on Brazil.  This is the way a large, global Tech company with a diverse population celebrates and shares diversity among it’s employees.  There are women coffee meetings for Women in the Cloud and Cricket games to celebrate those with East Indian or British connections to name a few.

In addition, the Museum collaborated with other Nonprofits who were sponsoring events with similar subject matter.  As a result of my efforts, we twice cohosted a benefit performance of an August Wison play with Seattle Repertory Theater.  The first year, we hosted “Radio Golf”  where we raised $4,956 from the performance for the Museum.  The next year, we hosted an Exclusive reception with Director Phylicia Rashad for the play “Gem of the Ocean.”  At this specific performance, we had 13 corporations present and raised over $13,000.  The point being the collaborations extended our reach and let us piggy back off of another organization’s expertise that related to our focus.  
I have connections with a few of the nonprofits in the area related to women and underrepresented minorities in Tech.  My daughter’s father, Eric Osborne is the co-founder of HERE Seattle, a networking and mentorship group for women and underrepresented minorities who are in the Tech field.  I can use synergies to ensure the HERE mailing list is up to date with the names from my ADA cohort ensuring each of them has invitations to HERE events.  ADA could co-host an event with HERE and I would be happy to be in charge of organizing the ADA portion with the students. 

My daughter attends Rain City Rock Camp for Girls each summer in Seattle.  It is also a program for transgender and non binary gender individuals.  Although the field and age group are unrelated, they also provide a Women’s Rock Camp twice yearly.  The Executive Director and cap staff are experts at running workshops which validate gender roles and choices in today’s society.  In one workshop, the girls chose pronouns that defined them.  Campers were able to choose to be either a “Her;” a “Him or a “They/Them.”  It may be worth collaborating with their staff on hosting a workshop or panel discussion at ADA.  The camp workshops cover everything from gender roles to self esteem and discussion of women’s portrayal in the media in a fun, outgoing environment.

The most important thing when dealing with those of various gender roles and/or sexual preferences is to remember we are all individuals with different interests.  I have bonded with a transgender female at work over tips on presentation styles because I know she is a strong presenter.  She has shared greetings with me in over 10 languages because she feels getting to know other culture’s greetings are important not to mention fun.  I talk to my daughter’s Godfather who is gay about his ring because he was married recently.  We also talk about the Huskies win and that they are headed to the Orange Bowl.  He is Vice President of Business and Legal Affairs for Fox Sports.  When dealing with individuals, I believe inclusiveness means taking that individual as an individual complete with their own interests and passions.  

My work with Urban Financial Services Coalition (UFSC) covered extending opportunities to women, African Americans, Latinos and other underrepresented minorities in the Financial Services fields.  The group hosts Scholarship Dinners, workshops and Oratorical competitions as well as a yearly Golf Tournament.  I attended a Movin On Up get together at the Columbia Tower Regency in which they have moved their offices.  During my tenure, I held roles like Sponsorship Chair, Marketing Communications Chair and co-planned the Annual Scholarship dinner.  I have been asked by my alma mater Stanford to participate in Alumni interviews.  I would be willing to perform outreach to those in underrepresented minorities either through interviewing candidates during Phase 2 and Phase 3 aspects of the application process or by attending Educational fairs or Recruiting events to engage women in the African American community as well as others.
