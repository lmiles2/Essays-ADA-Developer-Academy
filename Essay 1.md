**1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**

My entrée into programming occurred on my path to graduation from Stanford – the bastion of Computer Science where companies like Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Yahoo!, Google and SnapChat came into existence.  Though I was surrounded by these greats, my interests lay elsewhere.  I was focused on business and Marketing particularly in the Entertainment world.  These were different skill sets I needed to develop – I majored in Psychology and Communication to determine what made people want to buy things and what were the best ways to reach them.  I focused on Networking which I did by traveling to LA on my Spring Break talking to Stanford Alumni who were professionals in the Entertainment world like the Senior Vice President of Programming for ABC. 

Along the way, I took a computer course entitled Intro to Computer Science.  In this course, I wrote programs which rarely worked and it was difficult to find the reason why.  My TA was a male who all be it was African-American and had started an online portal for African-Americans called Net Noir, but I now realize I did not get much out of it
.  
I was tapped to apply for an internship at Microsoft by a Stanford Alum, Darrell Smith, who particularly wanted to encourage African-American students to pursue careers at Microsoft.  He told me with Visual Basic I could write my own ticket.  At the time, I didn’t even know that Visual Basic was a programming language.  The moment was pivotal in that one of the questions during my interview in the Marketing department at Microsoft Word was to name three ways I would improve the program.  I was intrigued by the question.  The maker of one of the mainstays of word processing was asking me, a student, for suggestions on improvements.  From that moment on, I looked at computer programs differently.  It empowered me.  Whenever I used a program, I put myself into it by evaluating how well it worked for me.  I noted when something could be done more easily and differently and I looked for different ways to accomplish the same thing in the program.   Although, I did not get the internship, I used the interview as a point of reference to continue to evaluate computer programs.  As a Visual Media Specialist (Graphic Designer) for the Sales Development department at Franklin Templeton, a major part of my job was to merge programs into PowerPoint via Lightwave 3D, Photoshop, Flash and Illustrator.  Lightwave 3D challenged me when needing to rely on Physics to create an image with texture, shadow, depth and lighting techniques.

During my tenure as an MBA student at University of Southern California Marshall School of Business, I interned in Entertainment.  In the Online Grassroots Marketing department at Universal Music Group, we used chat rooms to depict the popularity of movies, music, and online portals.  College student interns posed as members of chat rooms and talked how well they liked a single, CD or movie.  The Universal Music Group covered the online presence of everything under the Universal umbrella including music, films, online portals and themeparks.  I displayed the success of the **_OBrother Where Art Thou?_** Soundtrack using a Windows Media Promotion making use of a graph in PowerPoint which highlighted unique visitors were usually 7,592 per day, however, with the Windows Media Promotion the unique visitors jumped up to 19,592.  It was exactly where I wanted to be.  I lacked the java script programming skills behind the Flash, but had to make do when I designed a graffiti eCard for Def Jam’s Greatest Hits Vol.1.  My website was supposed to be a fan website for the movie Josie and the Pussycats but then it became an Official site because the Director’s deemed it that.  I was living my dream with what I had cobbled together.  Others would be faster.

This brings me to proof positive that programming had worked for me.  As Director of Development for the Northwest African American Museum, I programmed a pledge reminder report into our eTapestry donor database system which did not exist in eTapestry but instead was presented as an upsell for those needing it.  I offered to sell my version of the pledge reminder report to eTapestry, but the company insisted they knew how to create it – it was just an upsell.  They then responded by including a Read Me file online with all the (confusing) steps I took to create the report when they could have made it a simple function on the user interface.
I brought with me my skills learned as a Documentation Specialist, Trainer and Change Management professional for SAP at AIG SunAmerica to inform the report.  When I first started with the SAP team, I could barely form an email asking what it was I needed to ask.  I lacked that little understanding.  Then through training and writing training manuals which were used by over 2000+ executives began to see how the program was laid out and the structures that laid with it.  It was the understanding of the structures in the more user-friendly portions of SAP that allowed me to write the Pledge Reminder report in the eTapestry database.  Afterward, I also migrated the Urban League’s database with that of our own to create a stand-alone database for the Museum.

Throughout my career, I was a student of programming through the finished products I made, trained on and made use of daily. My next formal application of programming occurred a couple of years ago when I enrolled in free courses Aquent provided in Web Development using lessons in HTML, CSS and javascript.  I completed the HTML and CSS portions but needed Photoshop for the rest.  I exhausted avenues of procuring the program asking all my local family and other designers I knew if they had or could procure cheaper copies of the program.  The only public use one available existed on one computer at the Downtown Seattle Library and needed to be reserved in 2 hour increments daily.  So I fell short of learning the javascript which would have aided me at Universal or in a career in web development.  I have since subscribed to the Cloud version of Adobe Creative Suite at an affordable $20.00/mo.

My early years of intimidation with program grew over time to a realization that putting the pieces together, being a lifelong student and constantly evaluating the steps of a program and their usefulness transforms one into someone with the aptitude for programming.  When I took the Aquent course recently, I had much more of an understanding of how to do things and my finished products turned out correctly.

I went through the ADA Jumpstart curriculum in two days practicing a few of the exercises within as I read over the curriculum. I love the Grandma’s House idea and was able to break down my algorithm with qualifying measures my first try which I read in some of the materials later was a key component of the program.

I am now a Receptionist at Microsoft.  I book SCRUM meetings into conference rooms. Whether it is designing UX Design, live media streaming of the Olympics no less, creating PowerApps for businesses and individuals, quantifying the Cloud, I am exposed to innovative areas of technology which require programming and development.  I see the difference in roles and commitment between a Software Enfgineer, Software Engineer II, Senior Software Engineer, Principal Software Engineer, Principal Software Engineer Manager and so on.  I overhear conversations from meetings and witness the reliance on work in teams.  I see the push to ship products as well as the accompanying pressure and stress.

At this point of my career I now have the aptitude, attention to detail, patience, cognizance of patterns and structures as well as the passion to commit to a change in role to developer status.  The team environment that exists to make these moves is known by me.  The requirement of proactivity and starting project early as well as reaching out to mentors has been passed down to me through my experiences in my career thus far.  There are key areas of my career which necessitated a knowledge of programming and if I’d had them I would have been much further along.  I now have a strong desire to embark on this aspect of my career to move it forward with strength and learning.
